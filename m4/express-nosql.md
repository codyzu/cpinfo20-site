1. Click on "Add collection"

1. Give the collection the name `cities` and click "Next".

1. Collections only exist if they contain documents. Therefore, we are required to create an initial document.
   * We will use the city name as the.
   * The document should store enough information to show some the most recent searches and a count.
   * Click "Save" to store the first document

1. Add firebase-admin to your project:
   ```cmd
   npm install --save firebase-admin
   ```

Now we can access the [admin Firestore API](https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/firestore/latest/Firestore.html):
```javascript
const citiesCollection = admin.firestore().collection('cities');
```

Be sure to also read the [Firestore Documentation](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore).

#### Exercise 1.1: Update an associated city whenever a weather query occurs.

#### Exercise 1.2: Add a new route into your express server to display (with a pug template) the most popular cities ordered by most popular, i.e. `/popular`.
